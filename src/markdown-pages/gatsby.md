### Gatsby makes life easy.

It’s another static site generator like Hugo, Jekyll and so on. So what makes it special? Why are we talking specifically about it?

Gatsby can be used to build static sites that are Progressive Web Apps, follow the latest web standards, and are optimized to be highly performant. It makes use of the latest and popular technologies including ReactJS, Webpack, GraphQL, modern ES6+ JavaScript and CSS.

GraphQL + React + Webpack = ❤
This means a lot of developers can jump in without much of a learning curve as they already know or have at least used one piece of this tech stack Gatsby is built on.

Furthermore, I’d like to add something I noticed working with developers who had no idea about the latest frameworks and libraries and were just used to the traditional HTML, JavaScript, CSS files way of building sites.
